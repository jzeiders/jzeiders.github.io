    "Working with several roomates we created a custom lighting setup for the dorm. The setup consisted of 15 Meters of LEDs, one Arduino Mega, a Raspberry Pi, a microphone, an Iphone app, a Web App, an Android App, and a CLI interface. 
    My primary role in the project was building the web controller and designing the mobile and web applications. The project supported full RBG color and a variery of patterns along with features for integrating with music beats and frequenices.
